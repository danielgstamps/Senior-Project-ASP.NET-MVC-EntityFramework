Musts: 
- reports
- more testing

- moving an employee with baseline complete flags the cohort as baseline complete
	- disallow editing cohort after baseline is complete?

- stages: Should they be able to start over after summative?

Maybes:
- delete rater account if they close page early
- prevent spamming emails.
- Adding employee to a cohort: Catch them up? Reset?
