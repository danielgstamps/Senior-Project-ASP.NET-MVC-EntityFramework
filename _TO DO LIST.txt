Musts: 
- reports
- more testing
- print category titles on ViewEval
- email(s?) link to localhost?
- does notify crash if 1 has completed the eval?
- stages: Should they be able to start over after summative?
- raters: Change disable to only apply to in-progress raters
- "Notify all" buttons on empIndex/cohortDetails
- "Notify raters now?"

Maybes:
- delete rater account if they close page early
- prevent spamming emails.
- Adding employee to a cohort: Catch them up? Reset?


Eval breakdown:
3 stages: baseline -> formative -> summative
2 types: Type1 and Type2
	- Totally different sets of categories/questions.
	- Type1: 5 categories, 3 questions each, answer options 1-5.
	- Type2: 7 categories, 4 questions each, answer options 1-10.
	
Eval start/end time should be stored.

Admin powers:
- Assign eval(s) to a cohort: 
	- Choose type, stage, start/end dates.
		- Cohort editing/deletion is disabled if it has an open evaluation (current date is between start/end dates)
		- Type1 and Type2 evals can be assigned at the same time.
    - Sends notification email to employees, with a link to eval, type, stage, and start/end dates.
	- Needs to enforce stage order (can't take formative before baseline, etc.)
	- Select which other roles will evaluate the employee: 1 supervisor, 2 coworkers, 2 supervisees.
		- Note that the employee will choose who these people are when they take the eval.
		
Employee powers:
- Choose a supervisor, co-workers, and/or supervisees based on which roles were selected by the admin.
	- Can't pick the same person for different roles.
- View completed evals.
- Complete open evals.

Employee taking an eval: 
- Completes it for himself first.
- Sends email to the chosen peers evaluating him.
	- Has a link to the same eval (same type and stage)
	- NO LOGIN REQUIRED FOR THESE PEOPLE
		- we'll have to store their identity (or maybe just their role) somehow. Pass through the link?
	- Able to resend, only to peers who haven't finished the eval.
	- Able to disable/replace peers. Disabled peers should be marked as such, not removed.
	
Reports:
- Only generatable by admin.
	- Not sure exactly how they're supposed to be generated. 
	- find employee by cohort? Type/Stage filter optional?
	- "suppose the user chose to create a report for userid=3, stage=baseline, type=type1 on [date]."
	
- pdf format
- Shows:
	- Employee name
	- Eval stage
	- Eval type
	- Each question:
		- Self answers.
		- Supervisor answers.
		- AVERAGE of supervisees' answers.
		- AVERAGE of coworkers' answers.
		- AVERAGE of all.
